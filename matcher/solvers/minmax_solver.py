'''
A paper-reviewer assignment solver that ensures a minimum paper load per reviewer, if possible.

First calls an iteration of SimpleSolver with minimum reviewer loads,
then calls a second iteration, accounting for the results from the first iteration.

Arguments are the same as SimpleSolver,
except that the "num_reviews" argument is replaced by "minimums" and "maximums".

    "minimums" & "maximums":
    lists of length #reviewers. Each item in the lists is an
        integer representing the minimum/maximum number of reviews a reviewer
        should be assigned.
